# Project Title: Smart Calculator

<h2>Description:</h2>
In this project, you will create a console-based calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The focus is on building a user-friendly application with robust error handling.

<h3>Features to Implement:</h3>
1. Basic Arithmetic Operations: Implement addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.<br>
2. User Input: Accept input via the console. Users will:<br>
- Enter two numbers.<br>
- Select an operation (e.g., +, -, *, /).<br>
3. Error Handling: Handle invalid inputs gracefully. For example:<br>
- Division by zero: Display a clear error message and allow the user to re-enter inputs.<br>
- Non-numeric input: Prompt the user to enter valid numbers.<br>
4. Program Flow: After displaying the result, ask the user if they want to perform another calculation or exit the program.
